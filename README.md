##  :beginner: About
DeepBlue Pursuits is a website that allows users to shop for fishing rods and other fishing accessories. Users who visit the website will be registered as anonymous users using Firebase authentication. Users may add products to their shopping cart as well as checkout. The items in the shopping cart are stored using the Firestore database. They are also able to sign in with a user account or create a new user account. If a user creates a new account, they are able to migrate to a full account while keeping their cart contents. Once users are ready to purchase their items, the payments will be handled through the PayPal payment portal.
